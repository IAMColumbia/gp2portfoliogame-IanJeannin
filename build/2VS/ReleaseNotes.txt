Release Notes version 2 Vertical Slice

Improvements Made:
	- Refactored beats to be based on a timer rather than collision
	- Changed visual of beats to be akin to a metronome
	- Add basic menus
	- Changed attack grid values to floats, so damage can be adjusted per square
	- Add enemy spawner, with decreased spawn times as player kills enemies
	- Add resetting upon player death
	- Add brief input lock if player presses input inaccurately
	- Adjust AI movement to occur between player beats. This allows the player more reaction time.

Improvements to Make:
	- Check timer accuracy? 
	- Fix metronome bug where it only sometimes switches directions (could be due to timer inaccuracy)
	- Correct enemy walking into obstacles every now and then (Pathfinding innacurate only in some areas?)
	- Add Turn Management
	- Adjust AI mistake formula
	- Improve menus
